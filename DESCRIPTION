Description: This package allows you to simulate the behavior of information seeking agents in an artificial media environment,
    and construct a coexposure network that results from this simulation. It also allows you to run a full simulation of
    agents in the media environment for various values of a randomizing parameter that determines the extent to which 
    agents choose same type of outlet as themselves. For more details 
    see Mukerjee, S. (2021). A systematic comparison of community detection algorithms for measuring selective exposure 
    in co-exposure networks. Scientific Reports, 11(1), 1-11.
